# news-api
This project creates a REST-API using FLASK.

First is to scrape the web for news at specified sourcews like Reuters, Buzzfeed, etc. These items are then stored in a MongoDB database.
The goal is to be able to querry the database and return all items matching the querry.

The idea for this project was inspired by a Satrbucks aquaintance in the Spring of 2017. As a mobille developer working on Augmented Reality he wanted to be able to pull news items relevant to any situation from the web via an API.
